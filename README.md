# insta80s
a creative reimagination of Instagram set in the vibrant aesthetic of the 1980s. This project was developed for the Pixel Perfect web design competition, under the theme “What if Instagram existed in the 1980s?”. The entire interface blends nostalgia with functionality—featuring pixelated fonts, polaroid-style posts, and neon-accented UI components. The color scheme was carefully chosen based on research into popular 1980s visuals, where neon cyan, magenta, and electric blue dominated arcade machines, synthwave posters, and early computer UIs. These colors not only provide an authentic retro look but also enhance contrast, giving the site that old-school CRT screen feel. The layout includes classic Instagram features like Home, Explore, Upload, and user profiles, all wrapped in a pixel-grid-inspired design. Built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and minimal JavaScript, the site is responsive, functional, and rich in nostalgic character.also this isn’t just a design—it’s a flashback to floppy disks, vinyl records, and a time when everything digital had a glow.
