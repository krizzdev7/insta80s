# insta80s
a creative reimagination of how Instagram might have looked if it existed in the 1980s. Designed for the Pixel Perfect web design competition, this project blends the visual charm of the retro era with the familiar layout of a modern social media app. From pixelated fonts and arcade-inspired colors to CRT-style screen effects and polaroid-like photo feeds, RetroGram captures the nostalgic feel of old-school tech. Built using HTML, CSS (with Tailwind), and basic JavaScript, the design focuses on clean aesthetics, responsiveness across devices, and functional user interface elements. The site includes key pages such as a login screen, user feed, and profile section—all styled to reflect the bold and vibrant design language of the ‘80s. RetroGram celebrates a fusion of past and present, giving Instagram a vintage twist filled with fun, color, and personality.
